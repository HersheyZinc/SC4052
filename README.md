## Assignment 1
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable data transmission but faces challenges in data centers due to unpredictable latency and high throughput demands. This report explores various TCP alternatives optimized for data centers. Homa, a message-based, connectionless transport system, improves efficiency through RPC-based communication and minimal network state management. DCTCP leverages Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to adjust window size smoothly, maintaining low delays while preventing congestion. TCP CUBIC enhances scalability by using a cubic function for congestion control, optimizing performance in high-speed networks. The emerging TCP-LLM framework integrates large language models to enhance adaptability and efficiency in congestion control. Lastly, AIMD tuning experiments compare the convergence, efficiency, and fairness of AIMD, DCTCP, and CUBIC, highlighting their strengths and trade-offs in managing network congestion.
